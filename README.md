# Empirical-finance
This is a tutorial of empirical finance and is under constructing. The tutorial is to share codes to conduct empirical analyses.
Currently there are jupyter notebook version and python version. Jupyter notebook is an interactive platform with rich features, so the codes and
results will be better presented than other versions. I will add SAS version later on and may add Stata version.

***Please remember there may have some errors of the codes and this is just for your reference.***
